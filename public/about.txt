Hello! My name is Rebecca Eskek√§rr and am the developer for this project!

This is at the moment a small at-home-project but also a part of my portfolio.

To explain further, this project is at the very start of the devolopment-timeline
where I try to navigate how to work around backend-frontend aswell as connection to 
the various databases and the integration in between while also keeping functionality
and a sense of user-friendly design in the frontend.

If you have any further questions or want to contact me, 
my email is: rebecca@eskekarr.se

Hope you have a good day! :)
